Welcome! You are now in Codenvy, an excellent web-based IDE.

This is a (very) simple demo HTML/JavaScript application that is 
connected via REST to an Espresso Logic service.

We have created a database and the Espresso Logic project for you.
This app demonstrates how to manipulate the data in that database,
and how the logic and security defined in that project affect
the data.

To run this app: 
    1 - select Run->Run Application
    2 - click the link that appears in the Output window below.

To view the backend service for this app, use the following link:

https://livedemo.espressologic.com/LogicDesigner?serverName=https://livedemo.espressologic.com&userName=Demo_H7odd&apiKey=oXOADfe2QWtEk8V


Once you have familiarized yourself with the app, feel free to
browse its code in this IDE. You can even modify it and run it
right on the spot.
